# Git Push Instructions for What's Next App

To resolve the "rejected - fetch first" error when pushing to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. First, fetch the remote repository content
```
git fetch origin
```

## 2. Merge the remote changes with your local repository
```
git merge origin/main
```
Alternative: If you prefer to do both in one step:
```
git pull origin main
```

## 3. Resolve any merge conflicts
If there are conflicts, Git will show you which files have conflicts. Open those files, resolve the conflicts, then:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

## 4. Push your changes again
```
git push -u origin main
```

## If repository was initialized with README or other files
If the repository was created with a README or other initial files on GitHub, this is why your push was rejected. The steps above will bring those files into your local repository before pushing.

## Optional: Force Push (Use with caution!)
If you're certain you want your local version to completely replace the remote version, you can force push:
```
git push -f origin main
```
WARNING: This will overwrite any changes on the remote. Only use if you're sure you want to discard the remote changes.
